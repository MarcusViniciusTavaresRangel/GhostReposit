JS mostly
This is a repository for my JavaScript learnings and findings. 
There is a code where you type /d6 and it "rolls a dice". 
There's a dice roller for d100, d20, d12, d10, d8, d6 and a d4.
There's a button that rolls 3d6 for attributes in D&D or similar.
I'll continue, wish me luck and goos studies!
Thanks to all partners who collaborate!
